            <h1>Barangay 316</h1>
            <p>Barangay 316 is located at the heart of the 3rd Congressional District of Manila. It is bounded on the North by E. Remigio street, to the East by Oroquieta street, to the South by V. Fugoso street and to the West by Rizal Avenue.<br><br/> It was once the area of red lighthouses along the stretch of Rizal Avenue, from V. Fugoso Street to Mayhaligue Street but since then, it has undergone a major make-over since the early 1990s due to the continous emergence of medium to high rise buildings.<br><br/> The barangay belongs to a highly commercialized area due to the presence of Supermarket, Banks, and other business establishments, and has its building serving as the Barangay Hall and Barangay Tanod Hall. Other facilities include a barangay Chapel, library, multi-purpose covered basketball court which serves as temporary shelter and evacuation area for emergencies.<br><br/>Its total land area is approxiamately 1.296 hectares and based on the NSO record, the barangay's population as of 2020 is at 2,395 and as of 2021, the total household was at 620. Out of the estimated total population, 1,265 are females and the reamaining 1,130 are males. Our barangay has 260 persons belonging to the Youth Sector. We have 170 Senior Citizens as of this day.<br><br/> Barangay 316 belongs to the middle-income class of residents and is still in the process of changing from a residential zone to a highly urbanized community. The majority of our residents have their means of income from being private employees, store owners, government employees, business proprietors, and others.</p>
